# Introduction

Our dataset is based on GossipCop, which is proposed by FakeNewsNet([ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.01286))([Github](https://github.com/KaiDMML/FakeNewsNet))

We did some preprocessing:

| version |     feature      | legitimate | fake | total |
|:-------:|:----------------:|:----------:|:----:|:-----:|
|   v1    |  having ‚Äútext‚Äù   |   14991    | 4717 | 19708 |
|   v2    |  having ‚Äútitle‚Äù  |   14928    | 4706 | 19634 |
|   v3    | in proper length |   11945    | 3784 | 15729 |

We use v3 to do further processing.

We designed 7 ways to generate news.

- [Style-based Fake](#style-based-fake)
- [Content-based Fake](#content-based-fake)
- [Integration-based Fake](#integration-based-fake)
- [Story-based Fake](#story-based-fake)
- [Style-based Legitimate](#style-based-legitimate)
- [Integration-based Legitimate](#integration-based-legitimate)

Except for task "Content-based Fake", which uses [GLM4](https://www.chatglm.cn/) for generation, all other tasks use [ChatGLM3](https://github.com/THUDM/ChatGLM3).

The statistics for each task:

| Task Name                    | Total  |
| ---------------------------- |:------:|
| Style-based Fake             | 15729  |
| Content-based Fake           | 11941  |
| Integration-based Fake       |  2697  |
| Story-based Fake             | 15729  |
| Style-based Legitimate       | 11945  |
| Integration-based Legitimate |  5926  | 

We also download the related images of the GossipCop dataset. We remove the invalid images. 

Please refer to the **top_img** folder. 

The name rule of the image is `{news_id}_top_img.png`, such as `gossipcop-541230_top_img.png`. 

Each task has a field named `has_top_img` to indicate whether the news has an image. 
`1` mean the news has an image, `0` mean the news does not have an image.

For task `Integration-based Fake` and `Integration-based Legitimate`, each data is the integration of a pair of news. 
Therefore, the `has_top_img` field is equal to `1` if both news have images, otherwise, it is equal to `0`.

        "origin_text": "Born and raised in the Philippines, Lea Salonga grew up watching Disney movies and listening to Disney storybook tapes. Never did she imagine, though, that she would grow up to be a real-life, bona fide Disney Princess.\n\nThen, after earning a Tony Award for her portrayal of Kim in the Broadway musical ‚ÄúMiss Saigon‚Äù in 1991, Salonga landed the career break of a lifetime: to be the singing voice of Princess Jasmine in the 1992 hit Disney film ‚ÄúAladdin.‚Äù\n\nSix years later, she got a second chance to live her young girl‚Äôs dream as she performed the vocals of Mulan in the 1998 Disney film of that name.\n\n‚ÄúI never thought when I was 5 and listening to ‚ÄòCinderella‚Äô stories that I‚Äôd be a Disney princess. I think it‚Äôs such a magical thing to happen in my life, and for it to happen twice is something I would never have thought could happen,‚Äù said Salonga in a recent phone interview.\n\nSalonga‚Äôs distinctive voice will return to Southern California for concerts tonight at the Valley Performing Arts Center in Northridge and Saturday at Segerstrom Center for the Arts. Backed by a four-piece band, Salonga will perform a selection of well-known songs, including her greatest hits from her various musicals and films.\n\n‚ÄúWe made sure to choose a fun program that the band is going to dig playing and I‚Äôm going to love singing,‚Äù said Salonga, ‚Äúand because we are having so much fun onstage, I hope that translates to the audience as well.‚Äù\n\nSalonga is keeping the program‚Äôs song selections a secret for now, until she and her musical director decide on the set list; however, she promises all of the tunes will be familiar and fit her vocal range. Some of the songs, she added, will be making their California debut.\n\n‚ÄúThis will be the first time for California audiences to hear these songs, but there is nothing unknown or out of left field; stuff that always makes sense with my voice.‚Äù\n\nA regular feature of Salonga‚Äôs solo concerts is an audience participation segment, in which she chooses someone to join her onstage to sing the Grammy and Academy Award-winning duet ‚ÄúA Whole New World‚Äù from ‚ÄúAladdin.‚Äù\n\n‚ÄúNo need to panic; we always have a lyric sheet so anyone who dares to come up doesn‚Äôt have to have it memorized fully,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI want them to have fun.‚Äù\n\nSalonga has numerous Broadway credits, including her role as Eponine in the 1993 ‚ÄúLes Mis√©rables‚Äù Broadway run and as Fantine in the 2006 Broadway revival. She recently came off Broadway in the new musical ‚ÄúAllegiance,‚Äù which also starred George Takei and Telly Leung.\n\nSplitting her time between the U.S. and Manila, Salonga is a coach on the Philippine version of the television show ‚ÄúThe Voice.‚Äù In addition to her onscreen and onstage career, she has released several solo albums, including ‚ÄúI‚Äôd Like to Teach the World to Sing‚Äù (1997) and ‚ÄúBy Heart‚Äù (1999).\n\nOn this tour, Grammy-nominated bass player Trey Henry and drummer Ray Brinker, both from the jazz group Tierney Sutton Band, will back Salonga.\n\n‚ÄúI get to go up onstage with musicians who I really admire and respect, and just have a great time with,‚Äù Salonga said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs thrilling when I get to perform stuff where I can just emotionally let go and fly off to another world in my mind, and the audience gets to ride on that too.‚Äù\n\nContact the writer: jmoe@ocregister.com",

Tonya Harding says the Olympics have changed since she competed all those years ago.  \"Wow, I'm so glad I'm not competing against them now,\" Harding says of the Olympic figure skaters, noting that the \"point system\" has changed. \"I was all about doing the triple axel or the triple-triple, and now you can do the triple-triple and still get the same points that you would for the triple axel. So, why do the triple axel?\"  Harding was the first American woman to successfully do a triple axel in a competition, and recalls the moment she knew she landed the move. \"I was like, 'Yes! I did this!'\" she says. \"I competed for me but I performed for the people.\"  Harding also remembers being at the Olympics and thinking, \"Holy crap.\"  \"Then you have to remember to bring yourself back down to a level that this is just another competition,\" she explains. \"You're like that for a bit and then you start to look around and you're like, 'Holy crap, this is the Olympics.'\"  Harding has found herself back in the limelight this year after the success of the movie I, Tonya, which is about her life as a figure skater. She tells DeGeneres that she's quite happy with how the film turned out.  \"I achieved something in my life that meant something,\" she says. \"With the new movie, it actually made my life feel like it was worth something.\"  In January, Harding joined the I, Tonya cast at the Golden Globes and celebrated with Allison Janney after she won for her portrayal of LaVona Golden, Harding's mother.  \"She was overwhelmed by the movie,\" Janney told ET's Kevin Frazier of Harding's reaction to the critically acclaimed film. \"I think she's having a great moment. I think she loves it and I think she should because the movie tells a more nuanced side of her story.\"  Janney added, \"It's much more complicated then what we first thought when this incident happened back in the '90s.\"  Check out more of our exclusive interview with the Golden Globe winner:",

I really wonder, now that I have the time to think about it, how I did seven years of that show because just the legal dialogue alone. My mind was never still.‚Äù  Margulies said that right after she taped the last episode, she got sick. ‚ÄúI have been really actually wondering how I just kept going. So the exhaustion when it all finally ended, hit me with a bout of the chickenpox for two weeks. I felt like, sort of my body having to shut down and shed seven years of great hard work and start anew. I really took it that way.‚Äù  Related Link: ‚ÄòThe Good Wife‚Äô series finale reaches a frustrating verdict  Margulies, who has won two Emmy Awards for her work on ‚ÄúThe Good Wife,‚Äù admitted that she was surprised the hit show wasn‚Äôt nominated this year.  ‚ÄúI thought this season was our strongest season, to be honest,‚Äù Margulies said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs someone else‚Äôs turn.
